Given 14 characteristics describing different types of wines, along with an overall quality rating (dependent variable), this analysis helps to understand what makes a wine 'good.' The analysis is split into a model for white wines and red wines since characteristics that make a white wine 'good' may be different from what makes a red wine 'good.' The most important factors contributing to a 'good' white wine from a multiple linear regression model are having a low fixed and volatile acidity, along with high total sulfur dioxide, sulphates, and alcohol.
